# Character

## Attributes

These are the main stats, which all characters have.

* Accurate
* Cunning
* Discreet
* Persuasive
* Quick
* Resolute
* Strong
* Vigilant

## Secondary Attributes

Always present too. Generated from attributes.

* Corruption Threshold
* Defense
* Pain Threshold
* Toughness

Note that defense is dependent on the armor, so there will be a value for each armor set.

### Formulas

The secondary attributes are calculated like this:

* Corruption Threshold: Resolute / 2 (rounded up)
* Defense: Quick - armor malus
* Pain Threshold: Strong / 2 (rounded up)
* Toughness: Strong (minimum 10)

Defense may be modified by more things than the armor, for example the robust trait. For this it is better using this formula:

* Defense = Quick - Defense Reduction

## Additional Stats

Some additional statistics:

* Resolute for powers: resolute - armor malus

Note that resolute for powers is dependent on the armor, so there will be a value for each armor set.

### Armor

The armor value depends on the armor used. But there are several sources for armor, such as traits, which can stack.

Some of these sources are not real armor. For example robust ignores damage. 

### Damage Bonus

* Base damage
* Single attack
* For a type of weapon
* Advantage attacks

In these cases the additional attribute should be noted.

### Defense Value

Defense should be noted for all the possible attributes.

Defense is modified by aspects, for example armors with the cumbersome quality or the berserker ability.

### Initiative

### Mystical Power Ability

By default mystical powers are used with resolute modified by the armor encumbrance. Some aspects may change this formula. Some aspects may add additional attributes.
