# Stats

There are these types of value:

* Direct value
* Derived value

Direct values just contain a value.

Derived values generate the value from another set.

## Derived values

* Modifiers (apply attribute modifier function)
* Divided (divide the attribute)
* Divided with minimum (divide, but there is a lower limit to the value)
