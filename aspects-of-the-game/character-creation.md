# Character Creation

Check the character model for more information.

## Free form

By default it will use the free form mode, where all the options can be chosen.

## Templated

This mode allows creating a character by choosing among a set of options.

It will require the following steps:

* Choose a an archetype
* Choose a profession
* Pick among the available options

### Profession

These are special templates, only available during character creation as long as the character meets a certain criteria.

They are handled dynamically. The player can choose one and be told if he meets the requirements or not.

### Conditional options

Some options will be available only if the character has chosen other options.

* Archetype abilities require a set of abilities
* Professions require certain abilities, and at least one at master
* Exclusive options require a specific profession

The moment a character does not meet the criteria for any of these they become invalid options.

## Monster

Monsters can be created by using the free form method.
