# Aspects of the Game

The following aspects can be adapted into an application:

* Character creation
* Monster creation
* Artifact creation
* Ruins generation
* Codex

## Character Creation

There are two ways that a character could be created:

* Free form
* Templates

Free form lets creating characters by picking and choosing freely. It may show warnings if invalid options are selected, but won't forbid anything.

Using templates imposed constraints about how the character can be set up, letting only choose from a defined set of options.

## Monster Creation

It works just like character creation, only that it uses a different data set. They both can be merged.

## Artifact Creation

There are no hard rules for creating artifacts, so this would be a free form creator.

## Ruins Generation

A rough line for a ruin can be generated randomly.

## Codex

A codex contains all the data which a player or game master may require consulting. Things like:

* Monster list
* Artifacts list
* Items list
* Locations
