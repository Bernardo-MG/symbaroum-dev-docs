# Security

As the web application will support creating and storing data it will require a basic security.

The users will be able to login by user an external authentication service, and be handled a basic set of privileges.

Administrator users will have a higher level of control, but a user can't become an administrator automatically.

By default users can only edit their own data sets. While administrators can edit anything.
