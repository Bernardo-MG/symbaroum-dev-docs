# Values

## Dice Values

Some values are mapped to dice. These follow a direct progression from 1d4 up to 1d12:

|Level|Value|
|---|---|
|1|1d4|
|2|1d6|
|3|1d8|
|4|1d10|
|5|1d12|

Any level above 5 increases the result by +1, so level 6 would be 1d12+1.

Levels may be combined, so a level 2 and a level 1 rolls would become 1d6+1d4.
