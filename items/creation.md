# Item Creation

Some abilities allow creating items:

* Alchemy
* Artifact Crafting
* Blacksmith

Each offers a set of items to be crafted at each level.

## Alchemy

Allows creating elixirs of the same level as the ability or lower. The number created depends on the ability level.

|Skill level|Elixir lvl1|Elixir lvl2|Elixir lvl3|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|1|-|-|
|2|1d4|1|-|
|3|1d8|1d4|1|

## Artifact Crafting

Allows creating minor artifacts of the same level as the ability or lower.

## Blacksmith

At novice can create ordinary armors and weapons.

At adept can add one quality to the item.

At master can add and remove qualities.

Changing qualities alters the price, which is an important limitation.
